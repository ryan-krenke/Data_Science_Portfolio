# Data_Science_Portfolio
Key Data Science projects and work completed as part of the MSDS Program at Bellevue University.

Projects:

## ChildCareDataAnalysis3Mediums
  - Analysis of national childcare, company data, and national test data for a daycare center company. 
  - Data preparation and cleaning
    - Kept data from only Midwest states and median childcare costs. Merged with company cost dataset. Updated national test dataset based on school subjects
  - Three mediums
    - Medium 1 – Powerpoint presentation
      - Target audience of company leadership team. Bar charts created to show company costs by child age and differences between center and family-based childcare. 
    - Medium 2 – PowerBI Dashboard
      - Target audience of company leadership team. Tracking metrics of household income, unemployment rates, population, and number of households with kids/both parents work. Also a United States map of current and prospective locations
    - Medium 3 – Social media post
      - Target audience of current families and general public. Bar charts created to show average child test scores and comparable childcare costs. 
  - Libraries/Programs used
    - Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PowerBI

## Cleaning_FormattingAPIData
  - Cleaning and formatting data from an API data source
  - API Source – weather sensor data from purpleair.com
  - Methods
    - Pulled data from eight random sensors via an API call. 
    -Used JSON language processing to convert data into pandas datasets. 
    -Combined datasets from all states into one and kept only state and raw data. 
    -Cleaned data to remove brackets and whitespaces and unnecessary unique values associated with each values.
  - Libraries/Programs used
    -Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, NumPy, urllib, JSON 

## Cleaning_FormattingWebsiteTableData
  - Cleaning and formatting data from a website table source
  - Website source - https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/most_recent_data_states.htm 
  - Methods
    -Pulled recent state data from two HTML tables and convert data into pandas datasets.
    -Cleaned and analyzed data to understand aspects and ensure it is usable.
    -Pulled in another data table of location coordinates and combined the two datasets. 
  - Libraries/Programs used
    -Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, NumPy, Requests, Scipy

## Food_Fat_Level_Regression_Project
  - Cleaning and formatting data, performing exploratory data analysis, and predictive analysis with Logistic and Linear Regression modeling
  - Methods
    -Imported flat file source and convert into pandas datasets.
    -Exploratory data analysis with visualizations to understand potential correlations.
    -Binning data and creating dummy variables prior to modeling. 
    -Training and executing Logistic Regression model and evaluating with key metrics and confusion matrix. 
    -Performing feature selection to determine possible best features.
    -Training and executing Linear Regression models with value scaling and evaluating with key metrics.
  - Libraries/Programs used
    -Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, SelectKBest, Chi2, Cross_Val_Score
